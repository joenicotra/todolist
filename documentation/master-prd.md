# Things 3 Clone: Comprehensive Product Requirements Document

## Executive Overview

Things 3 represents the pinnacle of personal task management design within the Apple ecosystem, having won two Apple Design Awards for its exceptional user experience. This PRD provides a complete blueprint for creating a Things 3 clone, based on extensive research of its features, design patterns, technical architecture, and user workflows. The application combines GTD methodology with an invisible interface philosophy, creating a deceptively simple yet powerful productivity tool.

## Core Product Philosophy

### Design Principles

Things 3 succeeds through its "invisible interface" approach - the UI never interferes with focus on task content. The app appears simple on the surface while hiding powerful capabilities that reveal themselves contextually. This philosophy extends to the "magic paper" concept where tasks transform into clean white canvases ready for thoughts, and the careful balance between visual density and white space that creates a calm, focused environment.

### Target User Profile

The primary user is an individual productivity enthusiast within the Apple ecosystem who values design excellence, native performance, and a distraction-free experience over cross-platform availability or team collaboration features. These users typically follow some variation of GTD methodology but appreciate flexibility rather than rigid enforcement of productivity systems.

## Feature Specifications

### Task Management Core

#### Task Creation and Attributes

The foundation centers on quick, frictionless task creation with a comprehensive attribute system. Each task supports a title, rich text notes with Markdown formatting, checklists (up to 100 items), hierarchical tags, separate start dates and deadlines, time-based reminders, and contextual metadata. The system distinguishes between when to start a task and when it's due, allowing for realistic planning.

#### Quick Entry System

A global quick entry feature (Ctrl+Space on Mac) enables task creation from anywhere in the system, with autofill capabilities that intelligently grab content from the active application. This must be instantaneous and reliable, as it's the most critical feature for user adoption.

#### Natural Language Processing

The system parses dates and times from natural text input in multiple languages. It recognizes patterns like "tomorrow at 5pm," "next Friday," "in 3 weeks," and contextual shortcuts like "tod" for today or "tom" for tomorrow. This processing happens in real-time as users type.

### Organizational Hierarchy

#### Three-Level Structure

The organizational model follows Areas → Projects → Tasks, with optional headings for further subdivision. Areas represent broad life domains that persist indefinitely (Work, Personal, Health), while Projects are goal-oriented containers that can be completed. This structure provides flexibility without overwhelming complexity.

#### Smart Lists System

Six core smart lists organize tasks by temporal context:

- **Today**: Current day's tasks with integrated calendar events
- **Upcoming**: Future scheduled tasks organized by date
- **Anytime**: Tasks without specific dates
- **Someday**: Ideas for future consideration
- **Inbox**: Unprocessed task capture
- **Logbook**: Historical record of completed items

The Today view includes a special "This Evening" section for tasks that can only be done later in the day, reflecting real user behavior patterns.

### User Interface Design

#### Magic Plus Button

The signature interaction element is a draggable blue plus button that adapts based on drop location. Tapping creates a new task, dragging to a specific list position inserts the task there, dragging to the left margin creates a heading, and dragging to the sidebar creates a new project. This single gesture handles multiple creation scenarios intuitively.

#### Task Cards

When opened, tasks transform into "magic paper" - clean white cards with minimal UI elements. The main content area dominates for title and notes, while secondary details (tags, dates, checklists) are tucked into corners. This progressive disclosure keeps the interface clean while maintaining quick access to all features.

#### Visual Design System

The interface employs abundant white space with careful typography hierarchy. A muted color palette prevents visual strain while thoughtful color splashes provide visual hierarchy. Custom animations built on a proprietary toolkit create smooth, purposeful transitions that maintain spatial context. The dark mode implementation offers true black for OLED optimization while maintaining readability.

### Advanced Collaborative Features

#### List Sharing and Collaboration

Revolutionary enhancement over Things 3's individual-focused approach:

- **Granular Sharing Permissions**: Share specific areas, projects, or individual lists with different permission levels (View, Edit, Admin)

## Competitive Differentiation

Your Things 3 clone addresses the biggest gaps in the productivity tool market:

### Revolutionary Collaboration Without Complexity

Unlike Asana or Monday.com that overwhelm with features, or Todoist that lacks design sophistication, your application maintains Things 3's elegant simplicity while adding seamless team collaboration. The key differentiator is permission-based sharing that doesn't compromise the individual user experience.

### Web-First with Desktop-Quality UX

Most web-based task managers feel clunky compared to native apps. By implementing desktop-quality drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts, and real-time collaboration, you create a new category of sophisticated web productivity tools that rivals native applications.

### Intelligent Automation Without Lock-in

Rather than building a closed ecosystem like Notion or ClickUp, your open API and integration-first approach allows users to connect their entire productivity stack while maintaining data portability and avoiding vendor lock-in.

### Enhanced Features Beyond Things 3

While preserving Things 3's core philosophy, strategic enhancements address its limitations:

#### Team Productivity Features

- **Smart Workload Distribution**: AI-powered task assignment based on capacity and expertise

## Conclusion

Building a web-based Things 3 clone with collaborative features represents a unique opportunity to combine the best of individual productivity with modern team collaboration needs. By leveraging React's component architecture, C#/.NET's enterprise reliability, and Supabase's real-time capabilities, you can create a productivity platform that maintains Things 3's legendary user experience while addressing its collaboration limitations.

The key to success lies in preserving the "invisible interface" philosophy that made Things 3 exceptional - the UI should never interfere with the user's focus on their tasks, whether working individually or collaboratively. Your enhanced drag-and-drop functionality and real-time synchronization must feel as natural as the original's single-user experience.

The N-tier architecture provides the scalability needed for team adoption while the comprehensive integration ecosystem ensures the application fits seamlessly into existing workflows. By starting with a solid freemium model and growing into enterprise features, you can capture both individual productivity enthusiasts and business teams looking for sophisticated task management.

Your competitive advantage emerges from combining three typically separate categories: the design excellence of premium native apps like Things 3, the collaboration capabilities of modern team tools like Linear or Notion, and the integration ecosystem of automation platforms like Zapier. This convergence creates a new category of productivity tool that serves both individual contributors and collaborative teams without compromise.

The technical foundation using React, C#/.NET, Entity Framework, PostgreSQL, and Supabase provides the modern infrastructure needed to deliver desktop-quality experiences in the browser while maintaining the performance and reliability expectations of professional users. The real-time collaboration features, powered by Supabase's WebSocket infrastructure, enable the kind of seamless team coordination that defines next-generation productivity tools.

Success will be measured not just by user adoption, but by the depth of engagement - teams that truly embrace collaborative task management and individuals who experience the enhanced productivity that comes from intelligent automation and superior user experience design. By following this comprehensive PRD, you have the blueprint to create a productivity application that could define the future of team-based task management.
