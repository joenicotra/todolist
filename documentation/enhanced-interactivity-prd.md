# Enhanced Interactivity PRD
## Phase 1.5: Advanced User Interactions

### Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: July 5, 2025
- **Status**: In Development
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 Static HTML Implementation (Complete)

---

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines enhancements to the Things 3 clone that improve user experience through inline editing capabilities, context-aware interactions, and enhanced keyboard shortcuts. These features bridge the gap between static prototype and dynamic application behavior.

## Problem Statement

The current static implementation lacks:
1. **Inline creation workflows** - Users expect to create and edit areas/projects directly in context
2. **Editable content** - Areas and projects need description/notes capabilities
3. **Cross-browser keyboard shortcuts** - Current Cmd+N doesn't work reliably in web browsers
4. **Context awareness** - Task creation should be intelligent about current view state

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- Enable seamless inline creation of areas and projects
- Provide rich editing capabilities for organizational elements
- Implement reliable, context-aware keyboard shortcuts
- Maintain Things 3 design consistency

### Success Metrics
- Users can create areas/projects without modal interruptions
- 100% of areas/projects support inline editing
- Keyboard shortcuts work across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Context-aware task creation routes correctly 95% of the time

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Inline Area Management
**As a user**, I want to create new areas directly in the sidebar so that I can organize my work without interrupting my flow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clicking "New Area" creates an editable area in sidebar
- New area view opens in main content area
- Area name is editable on click
- Area supports notes section under title
- Changes save automatically on blur/enter

### Epic 2: Inline Project Management  
**As a user**, I want to create new projects with the same inline editing capabilities as areas.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clicking "New Project" creates an editable project in sidebar
- New project view opens in main content area
- Project name is editable on click
- Project supports notes section under title
- Projects can be nested under areas

### Epic 3: Enhanced Keyboard Shortcuts
**As a user**, I want reliable keyboard shortcuts that work in my web browser and understand my current context.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Option+N creates new task (cross-browser compatible)
- Task creation is context-aware:
  - Adds to current view if Today/Upcoming/Anytime/Someday/Inbox
  - Adds to Inbox and routes there if in Logbook/Trash
- Visual feedback shows where task will be created

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Implementation
1. **Inline Editing System**
   - Click-to-edit components for area/project names
   - Auto-expanding textarea for notes
   - Save on blur/enter, cancel on escape
   - Visual feedback during editing state

2. **Sidebar Management**
   - Dynamic area/project creation
   - Proper nesting and hierarchy
   - Drag-and-drop ordering (future enhancement)

3. **Context Detection**
   - Current view state tracking
   - Intelligent routing logic
   - User feedback for actions taken

4. **Keyboard Event Handling**
   - Cross-browser Option key detection
   - Event delegation for dynamic content
   - Conflict prevention with browser shortcuts

### Data Structure
```javascript
// Area Structure
{
  id: 'area-uuid',
  name: 'Work',
  notes: 'Professional projects and tasks',
  color: '#FF6B35',
  projects: ['project-uuid-1', 'project-uuid-2'],
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}

// Project Structure  
{
  id: 'project-uuid',
  name: 'Website Redesign',
  notes: 'Complete overhaul of company website',
  areaId: 'area-uuid',
  tasks: ['task-uuid-1', 'task-uuid-2'],
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### New Area Creation
1. User clicks "New Area" in dropdown
2. New area appears in sidebar with placeholder name selected
3. Main content switches to area view with editable title
4. User types area name, presses Enter
5. Notes section becomes available for editing
6. Area is ready for project/task creation

### New Project Creation
1. User clicks "New Project" in dropdown
2. If area is selected, project nests under it
3. New project appears in sidebar with placeholder name
4. Main content switches to project view
5. User edits name and notes inline
6. Project is ready for task creation

### Context-Aware Task Creation
1. User presses Option+N
2. System detects current view:
   - **Today/Upcoming/Anytime/Someday/Inbox**: Creates task in current view
   - **Logbook/Trash**: Creates task in Inbox, routes to Inbox
   - **Area/Project**: Creates task in that container
3. Inline task editor appears in appropriate location
4. Toast notification confirms where task was created

## Design Specifications

### Visual States
- **Editing State**: Blue border, focused input styling
- **Hover State**: Subtle background highlight
- **Empty State**: Placeholder text with muted styling
- **Notes Section**: Expandable textarea with minimal chrome

### Animations
- **Fade In**: New areas/projects appear with 300ms fade
- **Slide Focus**: Smooth transition to editing state
- **Context Switch**: 200ms view transition when routing

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order respects hierarchy
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels for dynamic content
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators during editing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Inline Editing (Week 1)
- [ ] Implement click-to-edit for area/project names
- [ ] Add notes sections with auto-expanding textareas
- [ ] Create save/cancel functionality

### Phase 2: Dynamic Creation (Week 1)
- [ ] Wire up "New Area" dropdown action
- [ ] Wire up "New Project" dropdown action  
- [ ] Implement sidebar insertion and view switching

### Phase 3: Enhanced Shortcuts (Week 1)
- [ ] Replace Cmd+N with Option+N
- [ ] Implement context detection logic
- [ ] Add intelligent routing for task creation

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Week 1)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Accessibility audit
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Browser Compatibility**: Option key behavior varies across browsers
- **State Management**: Complex view state without framework
- **Performance**: DOM manipulation for dynamic content

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive browser testing matrix
- Careful event delegation and cleanup
- Debounced save operations for performance

## Future Enhancements
- Drag-and-drop reordering of areas/projects
- Bulk operations (move multiple tasks)
- Advanced keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+Shift+N for projects)
- Collaborative editing indicators
- Undo/redo functionality
